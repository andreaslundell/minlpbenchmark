In this folder the solver logs as well as the Paver reports and the trace files that have been used to generate the data in the paper:

Jan Kronqvist, David E. Bernal, Andreas Lundell and Ignacio E. Grossman, A Review and Comparison of Solvers for Convex MINLP, Optimization and Engineering, 2018.

The folders are:

	Logs: Contains the solver log files zipped per solver

	PaverReports: Contains the following Paver reports in HTML:
	
		ALL:		All instances
		DVARS_HI/LO:	Instances with high/low discreteness
		NLVARS_HI/LO:	Instances with high/low linearity
		RELGAP_HI/LO:	Instances with high/low relaxation gap

	PaverText: Contains the same Paver reports in text format.

	TraceFiles: Contains the trace files for generating the reports above. 
                    For solvers not natively producing trace files, these have 
	            been generated by parsing their outputs.
